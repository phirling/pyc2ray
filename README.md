## Directories Explanations
* `pyc2ray`: Python package directory
* `src`: Sources for the extension modules:
    * `c2ray`: Fortran sources adapted from the original C2Ray source code
    * `octa`: C++/CUDA sources for the octa library
* `test`: Scripts to be run during development to check that the code produces the same output as a given benchmark

Other directories are debugging/development files and are not part of the final project.
