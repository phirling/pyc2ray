This single source test is used to determine where the top-down asymetry observed
before september 14th comes from. To compare with c2ray thouroughly, you need to set
cgs constants to exact same values, this includes pc, YEAR, h_over_k, two_pi_over_c

Findings:
- Asymetry remains when moving the source around
- Asymetry remains with and without shadow
- Using tables or not doesn't remove the asymetry
- The asymetry appears to be along the x axis
  (positive error at positive x, negative error at negative x)
