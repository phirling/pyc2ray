The pyc2ray package is structured as follows.

It relies on 2 compiled extension modules:
- libc2ray: Fortran subroutines from C2Ray, adapted and interfaced with python using f2py. ../src/pyc2ray/
- libocta: CUDA C++ implementation of the OCTA raytracing method, compiled with nvcc. ../src/octa/
The package expects the compiled shared libraries to be in the lib/ directory.

Rather than giving access to these modules directly to the user, they are managed internally and the user
only interacts with the main python module.

In the future, a cleaner approach using e.g. setuptools may be added, but for now the extension libraries
need to be compiled manually and copied to the package root directory, as explained in the Build section.
