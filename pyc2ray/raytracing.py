# =========================================================================
# This file contains the standalone raytracing subroutine, which may be
# useful for benchmarking or possibly other applications. When doing a full
# reionization simulation, please prefer the evolve3D subroutine, which
# includes all steps (raytracing, ODE solving, convergence checks)
# internally. This subroutine is only meant for specific use-cases.
#
# Raytracing can use either the sequential (subbox, cubic) technique which
# runs in Fortran on the CPU or the accelerated technique, which runs using
# the ASORA library on the GPU.
# 
# When using the latter, some notes apply:
# For performance reasons, the program minimizes the frequency at which
# data is moved between the CPU and the GPU (this is a big bottleneck).
# In particular, the radiation tables, which in principle shouldn't change
# over the run of a simulation, need to be copied separately to the GPU
# using the photo_table_to_device() method of the module.

    Warning: Calling this function with use_gpu = True assumes that the radiation
    tables have previously been copied to the GPU using photo_table_to_device()

    Parameters
    ----------
    dr : float
        Cell dimension in each direction in cm
    src_flux : 1D-array of shape (numsrc)
        Array containing the total ionizing flux of each source, normalized by S_star (1e48 by default)
    src_pos : 2D-array of shape (3,numsrc)
        Array containing the 3D grid position of each source, in Fortran indexing (from 1)
    r_RT : int
        Parameter which determines the size of the raytracing volume around each source:
        * When using CPU (cubic) RT, this sets the increment of the cubic region (subbox) that will be treated.
        Raytracing stops when either max_subbox is reached or when the photon loss is low enough. For example, if
        r_RT = 5, the size of the cube around the source will grow as 10^3, 20^3, ...
        * When using GPU (octahedral) RT with ASORA, this sets the size of the octahedron such that a sphere of
        radius r_RT fits inside the octahedron.

    use_gpu : bool
        Whether or not to use the GPU-accelerated ASORA library for raytracing.
    max_subbox : int
        Maximum subbox to raytrace when using CPU cubic raytracing. Has no effect when use_gpu is true
    loss_fraction : float
        Fraction of remaining photons below we stop ray-tracing (subbox technique). Has no effect when use_gpu is true
    ndens : 3D-array
        The hydrogen number density of each cell in cm^-3
    xh_av : 3D-array
        The ionized fraction of each cell to use for column density calculation. This is typically
        the time-averaged value over a timestep
    photo_thin_table : 1D-array
        Tabulated values of the integral ∫L_v*e^(-τ_v)/hv. When using GPU, this table needs to have been copied to the GPU
        in a separate (previous) step, using photo_table_to_device()
    minlogtau : float
        Base 10 log of the minimum value of the table in τ (excluding τ = 0)
    dlogtau : float
        Step size of the logτ-table  
    sig : float
        Constant photoionization cross-section of hydrogen in cm^2.
    stats : bool
        When using CPU raytracing, return number of subboxes used and photon loss. Parameter has no effect
        when using GPU RT. Default is False

    Returns
    -------
    phi_ion : 3D-array
        Photoionization rate of each cell due to all sources
    nsubbox : int, only when stats=True and use_gpu=False
        Total number of subbox increments used across all sources
    photonloss : float, only when stats=True and use_gpu=False
        Flux of photons that leaves the subbox used for RT
